body: |
  What is it for?
  ---------------
  The Data Ethics Framework guides appropriate and responsible data use in government and the wider public sector. It helps public servants understand ethical considerations, address these within their projects, and encourages responsible innovation.

  Who is it for?
  --------------
  This guidance is aimed at anyone working directly or indirectly with data in the public sector, including data practitioners (statisticians, analysts and data scientists), policymakers, operational staff and those helping produce data-informed insight.

  How to use it?
  --------------
  Teams should work through the framework together throughout the process of planning, implementing, and evaluating a new project. Each part of the framework is designed to be regularly revisited throughout your project, especially when any changes are made to your data collection, storage, analysis or sharing processes.

  Questions in each section will guide you through various ethical considerations in your project. Record your answers to create a data ethics assessment. The self-assessment scoring scale is designed to help you identify which aspects of your project need further work.

  Structure
  ---------
  The framework is split into overarching principles and specific actions. Overarching principles are applicable throughout the entire process and underpin all actions and all aspects of the project. Specific actions will guide you through different stages of the project and provide practical considerations.

  In addition, the framework provides specific actions you can take at each stage of the project to advance transparency, accountability, and fairness. These are marked within each section.
