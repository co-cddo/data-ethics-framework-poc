title: Evaluate your project using the Data and AI Ethics Assessment
position: 100
body: |
  The ethics self-assessment tool provides a structured set of questions to help teams identify and reflect on the ethical
  risks of their projects. It is aimed at individuals or teams working with data, data-driven tools, algorithmic tools, or
  AI, as part of delivering a project or service. End users, such as caseworkers, may also find this assessment and
  accompanying guidance useful, although the primary focus is on delivery teams.

  The Level 1 assessment is a short risk and impact assessment. It provides a recommendation as to whether teams should
  complete a Level 2 assessment based on a projectâ€™s estimated risk level. It is strongly recommended that any individual
  or team working on a data or AI project completes at a minimum the Level 1 assessment.

  Using this tool, teams can:

  - identify ethical risks across the project lifecycle
  - document their assessment to support project transparency
  - explore and discuss mitigation strategies to address identified risks

  The assessment is intended to prompt you to reflect on how your project is meeting ethical best practice. It is not intended
  to provide assurance or sign-off for a project.

  You can fill in the assessment during different stages of a project. We recommend using the assessment at a minimum during the
  scoping and planning phase of a project as well as before live deployment.
