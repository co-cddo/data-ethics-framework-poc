  ## Discovery - project scoping & planning

  At the start of your project, you should make sure that:

  - your project has a clear purpose and user need
  - you have identified and engaged relevant stakeholders
  - you have a diverse and representative team

  You should ask yourself and the team:
  - who could be negatively or positively affected?
  - do the potential risks outweigh the expected benefits?
  - what might be the long-term consequences or impact?
