  ## 1. Define and understand public benefit and user need

  When starting a public sector data project, you must have a clear articulation of its purpose. This includes having clarity on what public benefit the project is trying to achieve and what are the needs
  of the people who will be using the service or will be most directly affected by it.

  Score your project from 0 to 5 against this action where:

  - 0 means public benefit and user need are not clearly defined or understood
  - 5 means public benefit and user need are well defined and understood by all team members

  ### 1.1 Understand the wider public benefit
  - What are direct benefits for individuals in this project? (for example saving time when applying for a government service)
  - How does the project deliver positive social outcomes for the wider public?
  - How can you measure and communicate the benefits of this project to the public?
  - What are the groups that would be disadvantaged by the project or that would not benefit from the project? What can you do about this?

  ### 1.2 Understand unintended consequences of your project (fairness)
  - What would be the harm in not using data? What social outcomes might not be met?
  - What are the potential risks or negative consequences of the project versus the risk in not proceeding with the project?
  - Could the misuse of the data or algorithm or poor design of the project contribute to reinforcing social and ethical problems and inequalities?
  - What kind of mechanisms can you put in place to prevent this from happening?
  - What specific groups benefit from the project? What groups can be denied opportunities or face negative consequences because of the project?

  ### 1.3 Human rights considerations (fairness)
  - How does the design and implementation of the project or algorithm respect human rights and democratic values?
  - How does the project or algorithm work towards advancing human capabilities, advancing inclusion of underrepresented populations, reducing economic, social, gender, racial, and other inequalities?
  - What are the environmental implications of the project? How could they be mitigated?

  ### 1.4 Justify the benefit for the taxpayers and appropriate use of public resources in your project (accountability)
  - How can you demonstrate the value for money of your project?
  - Is there effective governance and decision-making oversight to ensure success of the project?
  - Do you have evidence to demonstrate all of the above?

  ### 1.5 Make your user need and public benefit transparent (transparency)
  - Where can you publish information on how the project delivers positive social outcomes for the public?
  - How have you shared your understanding of the user need with the user?

  ### 1.6 Understand the user need
  ‘User needs’ are the needs that a user has of a service, and which that service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for them. For more information about the user need, consult the
  GDS Service Manual.

  Example:

  - running and improving services
  - building new services
  - trialling new processes for internal operations
  - testing existing and new policies

  ### 1.7 Ensure there is a clear articulation of the problem before you start the project.

  Describe the user need in your project:

  *As a … I need/want/expect to… [what does the user want to do?] So that… [why does the user want to do this?]*

  #### Example 1: the Register to vote service’s user need:

  - As a UK resident
  - I want to get my details on the online electoral register
  - So that I can vote

  #### Example 2: user need when building a platform for fire safety checks:

  - As a data analyst working in a fire and rescue service
  - I need to identify homes which are likely to not have a smoke alarm fitted
  - So that I can advise how to prioritise fire safety checks

  #### For various user needs, using data can:

  - help you identify themes in large volumes of text
  - predict what will happen
  - automatically categorise stuff
  - spot something unusual
  - show you how things are connected to each other
  - spot patterns in large volumes of data
  - spot geographic patterns in services or data

  ### 1.8 Check if everyone in your team understands the user need and how using data can help
  Does everyone in your team understand the user need?

  Often projects involving data analysis are requested by non-practitioners - people with an ill-defined problem they would like to understand better. Reframing their request as a user need will help
  you understand what they’re asking for and why, or expose what you don’t know yet.

  ### 1.9 Repeatedly revisit your user need throughout the project
  Consider these questions as the project evolves:

  - What is the overall problem you’re trying to solve?
  - Who are the users of this data process or analysis?
  - What needs do they have?
