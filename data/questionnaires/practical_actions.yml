    title: Project Owner/Manager practical actions
    answers:
      why_what_how:
        label: Try to explain your project (‘why’, ‘what’, ‘how’) in plain language to a non-expert audience internally.
               If you’re unable to articulate how the use of data and/or AI solves a defined problem, then you should consider
               alternative solutions.
      maintain_detailed_records:
        label: Maintain detailed records of the project and the decisions that were made in its design. This could include how
               the project delivers positive social outcomes for the public; what the user need is that it tries to address;
               who the senior responsible owner of the project is; or how a relationship with a third party supplier was set up.
      consider_accessible_info:
        label: Consider where you can make information about a project or tool publicly accessible, for example on GitHub, in
               blogs, or on GOV.UK or your organisation’s webpage.
      atrs:
        label: If you’re a central government department or an arm’s length body within scope, you’re required to use the
               Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS). This means you must document information about any algorithmic
               tools you use in decision-making processes and make it clearly accessible to the public. Where a tool does not
               strictly fall within scope of the ATRS, it is still recommended practice to publish an ATRS record.
  data_worker_practical_actions:
    type: checkbox
    title: Data Worker practical actions
    answers:
      maintain_detailed_records:
        label: Maintain detailed records of all data sources used, as well as collection methods, licenses, and pre-processing
               steps.
      publish_dpia_eia:
        label: Publish DPIAs and EIAs where possible. Further information on this can be found in the Fairness and Privacy
               sections.
  technician_practical_actions:
    type: checkbox
    title: Practical actions for those responsible for technical aspects
    answers:
      maintain_detailed_records:
        label: Maintain a detailed record of all the design decisions and assumptions that have gone into the development of a
               solution
      create_and_update_datasheets:
        label: Create and regularly update model cards or datasheets that explain the model's purpose, performance limitations,
               and intended use cases.
      publish_source_code:
        label: If possible, publish your source code openly, for example on GitHub.
      explain_algorithms:
        label: Consider how explainable an algorithmic tool you are building is and try to build with explainability in mind.
               Consider how important explainability is for the use case it is intended for. In some cases, there may be
               trade-offs, for example between accuracy and explainability (e.g. deep learning methods are more accurate but
               easily not explainable).
      access_machine_learning_models:
        label: Utilise technical methods for assessing the interpretability of machine learning models, such as SHAP (SHapley
               Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations).
